## [ðŸ‘‰ Play it here! ðŸŽ®](https://hex-dots.herokuapp.com/)

A [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) game based on [Dots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X1s4aMSUrE), but with a hexagonal grid.

Built from [Phaser 3 Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template): a Phaser 3 project template with ES6 support via [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
that includes hot-reloading for development and production-ready builds.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## How to Play

* Drag across dots of the same color to clear them.
* Making a loop will clear all dots of that color.
* Clear as many dots as you can within the time limit!

## How to Run

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open localhost:8080 in a web browser
4. Have fun!
